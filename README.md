The steps involved in the data analysis:
1. Data Extraction – Gathering all the raw datasets to Power Query.
2. Data Cleaning – Checked for duplicate values, errors, null values that were to be removed for proper analysis.
3. Data Transformation – Involved addition of extra columns in dataset table in order to calculate certain measures such as “Start of the Week”, “Start of the Month”, “Month”, “Year” and so on. It also involved steps like rounding off values, fixing data type of various columns.
4. Data Modelling – Creating one – to – many relationships between the data tables.
5. Data Processing / Data Manipulation – Creating calculated columns and measures with the help of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) such as Total Orders, Total Revenue, Returns Rate, Revenue Targets, etc.
6. Data Visualization – The final step where an interactive dashboard was built with KPI’s, tables, matrices, charts and line trend graphs after all the data calculations were done.
 
A few insights from this dashboard:
1. United States has the highest number of Total Orders placed between 2020 – 2022 as compared to other countries.
2. The current Monthly Revenue has shown an increase of 3.31% as compared to the previous month.
3. Mr. Maurice Shan was the Top Customer on the basis of Total Revenue.
4. Water Bottle – 30 Oz had the highest orders with total of 3983.
